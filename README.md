# Yuki
Yuki is an evolving, multifunctional Discord bot designed to help manage servers and engage users with various features. Currently in its second version, Yuki aims to be more user-friendly, efficient, and packed with even more fun and utility features than before. The first version of Yuki was well-received, and now, we're working on something much bigger

## Features
- Server unformation: Get detailed server statistics such as member count, roles, and more
- Coinflip: Flip a coin
- Roll: Roll a number between 1 and the specified value
- Slowmode: Set slowmode for specific channels with custom time intervals
- Permissions management: Edit and manage role-based permissions for certain features

## Requirements
- Programming Language: Python
- Required Libraries: disnake (for interacting with Discord's API)
Install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip3 install disnake
```

## Setup
1. Create a bot on Discord:
- Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- Create a new application, then create a bot and obtain the bot token
- Replace the placeholder `INSERT-TOKEN` in the code with your bot token
2. Configure the bot:
- No specific configuration is required for this bot as it fetches data dynamically from the server.
3. Install Dependencies:
- On your machine, ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. You can check this by running:
```
python3 --version
```
- Install pip if it's not installed:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
- Install the required libraries with pip:
```
pip3 install disnake
```
4. Run the bot:
- You can run the bot using the following command:
```
python3 app.py
```
Make sure you are in the same directory as the `app.py` file or provide the full path to it

## How to Use
- Deploy: Clone the repository and configure your bot with the bot token.
- Run: Launch the bot on your server.

Interaction:
- Users can interact with commands like /server for server info, /coinflip to flip a coin, /roll to roll numbers, and more.
- The bot also allows server admins to manage slowmode and permissions.

## Future Plans
Yuki is still in its early stages, but the goal is to create a bot that offers a wide range of functionalities for Discord server management, entertainment, and engagement. Stay tuned for future updates as more features are added :>
